# manifest-evaluations
I will be checking the android manifests for apps on the Mest Quest Store to see if the reason Meta tags the app with "Eye tracking" is based on the permissions declared in the manifest, regardless of actual use in the app itself.

The APK files of the apps evaluated are included in this repository using Git LFS. If desired you can follow my manifest access quick guide and decode the files to access the Android Manifests, or look at the already extracted folder of them.
